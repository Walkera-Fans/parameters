Parameter files for copter FCs and devo TXs

This repository contains parameter files you can load on your copters via the appropriate tools (e.g. APM Planner).
For the time being, we do not support users on using these files themselves. None of the files are properly tested to work reliably, so far.

Do not use any of them, if you don't know what you are doing. Always backup your original parameters or model files before updating.

If you know your way around and still want to use them you're free to do so but we can't help you if you break something because of that.

This project is work in progress.
